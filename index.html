                    <p>My journey into web development, and just the world of academia in general has been a very non traditional one. I was born into poverty and experienced homelessness on and off for most of my childhood. My world was so small and it has taken a lot of time to grow. A huge step in that growth was graduating with my BS in Analytical chemistry at the age of 29 in 2019. The financial stability I have achieved with my degree has allowed me to start opening my mind to possibilities I would have never imagined, that is how I came to web development. I finally feel free to take risks and push the limits of what I'm capable of. I am so passionate about coding and the amount of expression and creativity it is allowing me to bring into my work. With web development I am able to combine my analytical and scientific background with my innate desire to create, and that excites me beyond words.
                  
                    Most of my life I have only focused on survival, but now I am ready to start focusing on thriving.</p>
